# Carpooling App UncoductorAmigo

_**Important Notice: This is an app still in development and has not been fully implemented yet. We appreciate your understanding.**_

_This project was designed by and thanks to the course "Programming for Engineering"... an elective class in the Systems and Computer Engineering program at the National University of Colombia. Our group's motivation is to use this assignment to try to help university students. This application focuses on the well-known CarPool system specifically designed for National University students. It aims to utilize the resources learned in class and individual resources to achieve our goal._

## Getting Started üöÄ

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. However, you can find the deployed application and use it at: [UnConductorAmigo](https://unconductoramigo.pythonanywhere.com/)._

Check out **Deployment** to learn how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites üìã

_Things you need to install the software and how to install them, besides Python, of course ([Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))._

```
pip install django django-crispy-forms numpy scikit-image scikit-learn scipy Pillow geopandas googlemaps humanfriendly folium
```

_Or you can install everything automatically by accessing the folder after cloning the repository (see how to do it below) and running the following commands to install the requirements._

```
cd conductor_amigo
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

### Installation üîß

_A series of step-by-step instructions that will teach you how to get the application running on your browser locally._

_**First Step**_

_You must access the folder where you want to save this project through the command prompt (cmd) on your computer and clone this repository or download it as a **ZIP** file._


```
cd tu_carpeta_deseada
git clone https://github.com/MateoPerez618/ppi_17.git
```

_Having cloned the repository, you should access the **Django** project folder._

```
cd EstadisticasWebPage/TuPrimerAnilisis
```


_Having entered the folder, you can see in the deployment section how to run the application._

## Deployment üì¶

_You will run a command to start your local **Django** server that you can access normally and use the app in the same way you would with the web version, but with the freedom to modify its code and the storage of your computer._

_It's time to run the following command..._

```
python manage.py runserver
```


_Now you can check if the application deploys correctly at this [link](http://127.0.0.1:8000/). It's time for you to have fun using the app üôÇ (Remember not to close the bash or your command prompt so that the app continues to work, and when you want to stop running the server, you can do it by executing the command ctrl + c)._

_You can find more information on how to start and manipulate a **Django** application at this [link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/)._
